Solving Transient Diffusion equation using Crank-Nicholson scheme and alternating line by line TDMA method

The problem of a rectangular plate (lx,ly) initially at some temperature (T0) with ends maintained at constant temperatures (T1, T2, T3, T4) is solved to demonstrate this method.

The output is written in a file named "Temperature_T_x_y.txt".
